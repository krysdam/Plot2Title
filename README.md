# What is this?
Plot2Title is my final project for Natural Language Processing at Northeastern. It is a tool for building and testing AIs (specifically, encoder-decoder RNNs) to predict movie titles based on movie summaries. For example, you could give a model a summary of the movie *The Matrix*, and the model would hopefully output "The Matrix."

# How do I use it?

Because this was a course project, I built it with only myself in mind, so it's not very user-friendly. Right now, the way to use it is to look at the instructions at the top of main.py which explain how to build or test a model.
